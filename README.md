The Password Generator allows for the user to generate a random password that has multiple characters. It allows for the user to generate a password that is between 8 and 128 random characters and is very quick. In the event that a someone needs to create a good password this concept would work. This is a great project because it is not super complicated and can be inputed in any application. It is unique because is offers a wide variety of options for what type of password the user can create.
